Tim is one of our software developers and has been working on our ocean and coastal survey tools. Tim’s experience has been largely focused on building decision support tools – everything from wildfire and vegetation dynamics, to forest inventory to intelligence analysis. He helped start a Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning, and has experience developing statistical models to help understand the long term dynamics of climate change. Tim has a BS in computer science at Oregon State University and grew up in Denver, CO and Gresham, OR. He spends his free time surfing the awe-inspiring waves on the Oregon coast.
