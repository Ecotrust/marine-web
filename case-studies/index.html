  			<h2>Digital Deck U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico</h2>
  			<p class="dark">Rethinking Paper Catch Reports</p>
			<p>Fishermen and fisheries managers in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) have expressed a need for a complete and real-time approach to accessing fishery harvest information. Proactive, collaborative fisheries resource management to deliver long-term economic and biodiversity health requires near-to-real time data.</p>
			<p>Working closely with fishermen and fisheries in the US Virgin Islands, Point 97 designed the Digital Deck platform, a data collection and reporting tool designed to transition legacy, manual and error prone data practices into reliable fishery harvest data. Digital Deck delivers a simple, easy-to-use interface via cell phone, tablet or computer technology, enabling fishermen to digitally collect their harvest data and easily transmit the data to fisheries managers.</p>

      <p class="dark">The Problem</p>
  			
  			<p>Tracking fish harvest in near-to-real time ensures that USVI fisheries managers can assess harvests in relation to established Annual Catch Limits, and that fisherman can monitor their catch totals against catch quotas. USVI fishermen have the added benefit of accessing their historical trip data, informing future business planning. Over time, Point 97’s Digital Deck platform promotes collaborative fishing efforts among fishermen, better tracking and management of fisheries data, and adds market value to seafood, while empowering fishermen to make better harvest decisions.</p>

  			<p>Most fisheries managers and fishermen would acknowledge paper log reports and manual data entry is time consuming, inefficient, and lacks historical track-back methods for management and fishing business optimization. Translating and digitizing the dense paper catch reports is the first step towards creating resource management efficiencies. In the case of USVI, the Point 97 team analyzed the paper catch report forms currently used across St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix and Puerto Rico, respectively.  Recognizing each paper form supports dense and unique data entry points covering all of the main types of fisheries (hook and line, traps, nets, spear/hand), the Point 97 team broke these forms down into smaller groups of questions, documenting the validation required at each step of the fisherman’s input.</p>

  			<h2>Digital Deck Solomon Islands, HapiFis</h2>
  			<p class="dark">Collect and manage fisheries data more efficiently</p>
  			Point 97 linked up with the Solomon Islands government and the Coral Triangle Initiative to develop a new mobile
  			app that will improve the ability of surveyors to record exactly what kind of
  			fish and how much is entering Solomon Island fish markets. The new mobile app, called Hapi
  			Fis, will allow accurate recording and instantaneous wireless transmission
  			of fish survey information to a database programmed to analyze the data and
  			generate useful reports for managers, on demand.</p>
  			<p>By improving on flawed paper survey systems, the
  			government will have better understanding of total catch across the islands. The app sets 
  			an example for other Coral Triangle and Pacific countries by using technology
  			to support local economies and food security for inshore fisheries.</p>
 			<p>Digital Deck is designed to meet the expressed needs of community fishing organizations and fisheries agencies for collecting and integrating fisheries data supporting harvest accountability, traceability, collaborative research, spatial planning, and monitoring.</p>

  			<h2>Marine Planner: MARCO</h2>
  			<p class="dark">Collaborative planning and engagement</p>
 			  <p>MARCO is a data portal Point 97 built and rolled out to the Mid-Atlantic region. 57 million people live in this region, with millions accessing the coastal areas spanning recreational activities, fishing and wind developers. The Port of NY/NJ process about 3.2 million containers a year and commercial fisherman generate about $300 million in seafood. Against this background are wind developers seeking to supply energy to about 40 million homes. </p>

        <p>The MARCO portal pulls together disparate data and provides a platform that equalizes various interests in the ocean so that various stakeholders speak the same language and can map their interests in a simple way–allowing users to accurately weigh their trade-offs AND collaborate on decisions.</p>
