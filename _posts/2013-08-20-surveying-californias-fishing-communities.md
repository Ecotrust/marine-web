As part of the Marine Life Protection Act process, we conducted 1,812 interviews
with commercial, charter, and recreational fishermen to illustrate spatial
use patterns of major coastal fisheries in California. Fishing
communities collaborated in developing, refining, and validating final maps to inform
the design of marine protected areas.
