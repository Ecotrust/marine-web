Cheryl is a marine planning project manager and stakeholder engagement and advisory specialist. Her work focuses on large scale spatial data collection projects that map human use patterns to inform marine spatial planning efforts. These projects typically involve extensive community engagement and collaboration, mixed methods survey design, spatial survey tool design/development, and spatial data analytics. Before coming to Point 97 Cheryl worked as a Project Coordinator for the Coral Reef Alliance. She holds a Master in Environmental Science and Management and is a PhD Candidate in Geography at UC Santa Barbara. Cherylâ€™s favorite place is underwater and whenever she gets a chance she dons her SCUBA gear and heads to warmer waters--such as the Caribbean island of Bonaire.
