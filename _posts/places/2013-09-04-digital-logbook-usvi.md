		<p class="dark">Rethinking Paper Catch Reports</p>
	<p>Fishermen and fisheries managers in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) have expressed a need for a complete and real-time approach to accessing fishery harvest information. Proactive, collaborative fisheries resource management to deliver long-term economic and biodiversity health requires near-to-real time data.</p>
	<p>Working closely with fishermen and fisheries in the US Virgin Islands, Point 97 designed the Digital Deck platform, a data collection and reporting tool designed to transition legacy, manual and error prone data practices into reliable fishery harvest data. Digital Deck delivers a simple, easy-to-use interface via cell phone, tablet or computer technology, enabling fishermen to digitally collect their harvest data and easily transmit the data to fisheries managers.</p>

			<p class="dark">The Problem</p>	
		<p>Tracking fish harvest in near-to-real time ensures that USVI fisheries managers can assess harvests in relation to established Annual Catch Limits, and that fisherman can monitor their catch totals against catch quotas. USVI fishermen have the added benefit of accessing their historical trip data, informing future business planning. Over time, Point 97’s Digital Deck platform promotes collaborative fishing efforts among fishermen, better tracking and management of fisheries data, and adds market value to seafood, while empowering fishermen to make better harvest decisions.</p>
		<p>Most fisheries managers and fishermen would acknowledge paper log reports and manual data entry is time consuming, inefficient, and lacks historical track-back methods for management and fishing business optimization. Translating and digitizing the dense paper catch reports is the first step towards creating resource management efficiencies. In the case of USVI, the Point 97 team analyzed the paper catch report forms currently used across St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix and Puerto Rico, respectively.  Recognizing each paper form supports dense and unique data entry points covering all of the main types of fisheries (hook and line, traps, nets, spear/hand), the Point 97 team broke these forms down into smaller groups of questions, documenting the validation required at each step of the fisherman’s input.</p>
