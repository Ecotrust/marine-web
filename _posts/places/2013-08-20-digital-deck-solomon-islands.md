		<h2>Digital Deck Solomon Islands, HapiFis</h2>
		<p class="dark">Collect and manage fisheries data more efficiently</p>
		<p>Point 97 linked up with the Solomon Islands government and the Coral Triangle Initiative to develop a new mobile
		app that will improve the ability of surveyors to record exactly what kind of
		fish and how much is entering Solomon Island fish markets. The new mobile app, called Hapi
		Fis, will allow accurate recording and instantaneous wireless transmission
		of fish survey information to a database programmed to analyze the data and
		generate useful reports for managers, on demand.</p>
		<p>By improving on flawed paper survey systems, the
		government will have better understanding of total catch across the islands. The app sets 
		an example for other Coral Triangle and Pacific countries by using technology
		to support local economies and food security for inshore fisheries.</p>
		<p>Digital Deck is designed to meet the expressed needs of community fishing organizations and fisheries agencies for collecting and integrating fisheries data supporting harvest accountability, traceability, collaborative research, spatial planning, and monitoring.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mobile data capture at sea</li>
			<li>Access to catch history</li>
			<li>Meet agency logbook requirements</li>
			<li>Track progress towards fishery management goals</li>
			<li>Open Source License</li>
