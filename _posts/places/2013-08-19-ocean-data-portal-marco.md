		<h2>Marine Planner: MARCO</h2>
		<p class="dark">Collaborative planning and engagement</p>
		<p>MARCO is a data portal Point 97 built and rolled out to the Mid-Atlantic region. 57 million people live in this region, with millions accessing the coastal areas spanning recreational activities, fishing and wind developers. The Port of NY/NJ process about 3.2 million containers a year and commercial fisherman generate about $300 million in seafood. Against this background are wind developers seeking to supply energy to about 40 million homes. </p>
    	<p>The MARCO portal pulls together disparate data and provides a platform that equalizes various interests in the ocean so that various stakeholders speak the same language and can map their interests in a simple way–allowing users to accurately weigh their trade-offs AND collaborate on decisions.</p>
