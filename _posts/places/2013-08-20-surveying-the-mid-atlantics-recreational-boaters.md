blurb: Ocean planning is underway in the Mid-Atlantic. To ensure the most up to date information is available to regional planners, we designed a survey tool that allows boaters to input important trip information. This information will provide a better understanding of where recreational boaters use the ocean and ensure that these areas are incorporated into the planning process.
